# Daily Trends

-----

This is a combination of automated software in form of python scripts that gathers data from trending twitter topics in a specified region (which may be a city or country) and uses Natural Language Processing techniques (see the summarize.py script) to produce a news article from tweets related to every scrapped topic.  
The news articles are then sent to a user's inbox (email in this case) at the end of the day for reading.

### Project Deployment
